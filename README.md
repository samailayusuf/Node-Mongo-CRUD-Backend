# Node-Mongo-CRUD-Backend
A Node/Express CRUD operations on a Mongodb Database. With User authentication (using JSON web token and bcrypt)...  {I did this after learning Node/Express/Mongo on Openclassroom}

## How to use
-> Clone repo
-> run `npm install`
-> using postman or any API client, test routes.
-> Add new product (POST), UPDATE, GET, and DELETE
-> see thing.js for schema description
-> type`node server` to run application (server.js is the entry point)


Happy tweaking!
