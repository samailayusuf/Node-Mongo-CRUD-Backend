# Node-Mongo-CRUD-Backend
A Node/Express CRUD operations on a Mongodb Database... {I did this after learning Node/Express/Mongo}

#How to use
-> Clone repo
-> run `npm install`
-> using postman or any API client, test routes.
-> Add new product, update, GET, and delete
-> see thing.js for schema description
-> type`node server` to run application (server.js is the entry point)

Happy tweaking!
